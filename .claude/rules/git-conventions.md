# Git Conventions

## Branch Naming

```
<type>/<issue-id>-<short-description>

# Examples:
feat/AUTH-42-jwt-refresh-rotation
fix/API-118-null-pointer-on-empty-cart
refactor/DB-77-normalize-user-table
test/CORE-55-add-payment-edge-cases
docs/README-update-setup-instructions
chore/CI-33-upgrade-node-to-22
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`

Always branch from the latest `main`:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b <type>/<issue-id>-<short-description>
```

## Commit Messages (Conventional Commits)

## Commit Frequency

- Commit after every Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Each commit must compile and pass tests
- Stage intentionally — use specific files, not `git add .`

## Documentation Updates

Before pushing, review whether documentation needs updating:

- New public function/class → add Google-style docstring
- Changed behavior or API → update README usage section
- Added/removed files or commands → update CLAUDE.md structure
- Changed setup or dependencies → update README getting started

Use `docs(<scope>): <description>` commits for documentation-only
changes. If docs are part of a feature, include them in the
`feat` commit.

## Version Bump

Before merging to main, bump the `version` field in `pyproject.toml`.
The `release-and-tag.yml` workflow creates a git tag from this version.
If the tag already exists the release will fail.

Verify the version has been bumped before pushing:
```bash
git fetch origin main
git diff origin/main -- pyproject.toml | grep '+version'
```

## Push Frequency

- Push every 3-5 commits or at end of session
- Run full quality suite before pushing:
  `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`
- Verify version bump:
  `git diff origin/main -- pyproject.toml | grep '+version'`
- Rebase on main before pushing:
  `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Target: **< 400 lines** changed
- Title: short, imperative, under 70 characters
- Body: Summary, Related Issue, Changes list, Test plan
- Self-review the diff before requesting review
- Squash and merge to main (one commit per PR)
